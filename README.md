# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

As a project I refactored this code:

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
-Added header and footer tags
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes 
-Added alt attributes to all images
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order 
-Changed an h2 element to an h3 element
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title 
-Changed title to web page
-Combined redundant CSS elements
-Fixed a broken Search Engine Optimization link
-Added comments to the CSS
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
